Tidy Tuesday for 2020-05-05
=============================

Tidy Tuesday looking at the distribution of Animal Crossing villager birthdays.

In the process, I came across an interesting derivative of the birthday problem.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem

Here I found that there are no days with 3 birthdays out of 391 villagers.
What is the probability of this occuring?
